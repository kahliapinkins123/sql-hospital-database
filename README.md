## About The Project


This is a Hospital Database built with SQL. It contains several tables with data related to hospital departments, nurses, patients, etc. Many of the tables relate to one another, creating a complex SQL schema. After creating the database, I explored the data using SQL queries that could provide interesting insights into hospital employee and patient trends. The SQL queries include simple to advanced SQL, ranging from Joins, Aggregates, Window Functions, and Subqueries. Listed below are the schema of all of the tables in the hospital database: 

<h3>Patient</h3>

## Exploring the Data

After creating the database, I wanted to explore the data further to identify trends and extract important information. I did this using SQL queries. Some of the questions that are explored in this project are listed below : 
    <ol>
        <li>Which patients have cancer?</li>
        <li>How many patients are being treated for COVID-19?</li>
        <li>What is the average weight for patients who suffered a heart attack?</li>
        <li>What are the common diseases for patients over 60?</li>
        <li>What is the average salary of male nurses vs. the average salary of female nurse?</li>
        <li>What is the average age of patients in each department?</li>
        <li>Which patients under 18 have the flu?</li>
        <li>How many milligrams of Ciprofloxacin total will be admistered in a day?</li>
        <li>Which departments have the highest average bill?</li>
        <li>Which nurses are treating patients with pneumonia?</li>
        <li>Are there more females or males in Intensive Care?</li>
        <li>Which disease does the eldest patient in the hospital have?</li>
    </ol>
    
<p>Questions like these helped me to get a better understanding of the hospital data that I'm working with and allowed me to identify trends and patterns for further analysis or to influence future decisions in the hospital.</p>
